A lot of people(including me) are interested in crypto but also a lot of them don't have enough time to analyse all this crypto data. 
So I came to the conclusion that it would be interesting to see which cryptocurrencies are popular in crypto funds and make some a portfolio based on this data.

It's not a financial advice. It was just done only to practice my skills and also to satisfy my own curiosity.
